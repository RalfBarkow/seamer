- cglib proxy does not record first invocation?

- can capturing class be stored as well?

- location not in target but somewhere else. maybe configurable.
- method by name does not work well Set vs Hashset arg, argsClasses unused in ProxySeam
- cglib and aspectj proxy variant does not work with closures like lambdas do.
- SRP: split seamer into two parts, one of which will persist seam and record invocations, and another one that will just execute recorded invocations?
- degenerate test: file does not contain pair but something else
